Task

## Situation
Paysera users can go to a branch to cash in and/or cash out from Paysera account. There are also commission fees for both cash in and cash out. Only supported currency is EUR.

## Commission Fees

### For Cash In
Commission fee - 0.03% from total amount, but no more than 5.00 EUR.

You can get configuration from [API](https://private-00d723-paysera.apiary-proxy.com/cash-in)

### For Cash Out
There are different commission fees for cash out for natural and legal persons.

#### Natural Persons
Default commission fee - 0.3% from cash out amount.

1000.00 EUR per week (from monday to sunday) is free of charge.

If total cash out amount is exceeded - commission is calculated only from exceeded amount (that is, for 1000.00 EUR there is still no commission fee).

You can get configuration from [API](https://private-00d723-paysera.apiary-proxy.com/cash-out-natural)

#### Legal persons
Commission fee - 0.3% from amount, but not less than 0.50 EUR for operation.

You can get configuration from [API](https://private-00d723-paysera.apiary-proxy.com/cash-out-juridical)

### Rounding
After calculating commission fee, it's rounded to the smallest currency item (for example, for EUR currency - cents) to upper bound (ceiled). For example, 0.023 EUR should be rounded to 3 Euro cents.

## Input data
Input data is given in JSON file. Performed operations are given in that file. In each object following data is provided:
```js
{
    "date": "2016-01-05", // operation date in format `Y-m-d`
    "user_id": 1, // user id, integer
    "user_type": "natural", // user type, one of “natural”(natural person) or “juridical”(legal person)
    "type": "cash_in", // operation type, one of “cash_in” or “cash_out”
    "operation": {
        "amount": 200, // operation amount(for example `2.12` or `3`)
        "currency": "EUR" // operation currency `EUR`
    }
}
```
All operations are ordered by their date ascendingly.

## Expected Result
As a single argument program must accept a path to the input file.

Program must output result to stdout.

Result - calculated commission fees for each operation. In each line only final calculated commission fee must be provided without currency.

## Common setup

Clone the repo and install the dependencies.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/elham-sedighi/feecalculation---Angular.git
cd feecalculation---Angular-master
```

```bash
npm install
```

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.

## Further help

To get more help on the Angular CLI use `ng help` or go check out the [Angular CLI Overview and Command Reference](https://angular.io/cli) page.
